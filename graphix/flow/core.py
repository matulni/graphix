        The open graph with respect to which the XZ-corrections are defined.
    x_corrections : Mapping[int, AbstractSet[int]]
        Mapping of X-corrections: in each (`key`, `value`) pair, `key` is a measured node, and `value` is the set of nodes on which an X-correction must be applied depending on the measurement result of `key`.
    z_corrections : Mapping[int, AbstractSet[int]]
        Mapping of Z-corrections: in each (`key`, `value`) pair, `key` is a measured node, and `value` is the set of nodes on which an Z-correction must be applied depending on the measurement result of `key`.
    partial_order_layers : Sequence[AbstractSet[int]]
        Partial order between corrected qubits in a layer form. In particular, the set `layers[i]` comprises the nodes in layer `i`. Nodes in layer `i` are "larger" in the partial order than nodes in layer `i+1`. Layer 0 always contains all the output nodes (an empty set if the open graph does not have any outputs).

    Notes
    -----
    The XZ-corrections mappings define a partial order, therefore, only `og`, `x_corrections` and `z_corrections` are necessary to initialize an `XZCorrections` instance (see :func:`XZCorrections.from_measured_nodes_mapping`). However, XZ-corrections are often extracted from a flow whose partial order is known and can be used to construct a pattern, so it can also be passed as an argument to the `dataclass` constructor. The correctness of the input parameters is not verified automatically.

    - See Definition 5 in Ref. [1] for a definition of Pauli flow.

    - The flow's correction function defines a partial order (see Def. 2.8 and 2.9, Lemma 2.11 and Theorem 2.12 in Ref.
